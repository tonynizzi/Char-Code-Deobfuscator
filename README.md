Char-Code-Deobfuscator

Supply a basic char code string that matches the below requirements and receive the ASCII conversion in return. Please note, at this time, only "+" and "&" are supported for chaining chars. This will quickly be expanded to additional forms of obfuscation as needed.

This is the first semi-useful program I have written. It is likely the least efficient, quasi-broken implementation of the goal intended but this ultimate goal was to learn basic Python. I have no background in computer science or programming whatsoever, but I also recognize that you have to start somewhere ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

Conversion back to Python 2.7 would likely be exceedingly simple if needed.
